I was pretty amused when Tic Tac Toe first surfaced in the Flatiron curriculum. *Tic Tac Toe is so fun and it's so simple, anyone can play!* Play, yes. Build, no. At least at first.

When I reflect on what the Tic Tac Toe challenge was like for me, the first thing that comes to mind is how GRATEFUL I am for error messages. If the pre-Flatiron me read those words, I would seriously wonder *what is wrong with this girl?* But no, I'm not a masochist. Quite the opposite in this case. 

Seeing the error count in red and chiseling my way through each one (I think the most I remember in one lesson was forty-something!) until the screen was left with nothing but that glorious green text was the best feeling in the world. (Or pretty high up there at least.) I'd be fist-pumping alone in my apartment or surrounded by people in a coffee shop after I finallllllly made it through to the other side because I worked so hard for it! It was aggravating and rewarding and totally systematic. No "work" has made me that excited in a long time. 

Back to Tic Tac Toe itself. At the beginning of this, I definitely spent way longer than I needed to on what turned out to be simple stuff. For example, just setting up the board at first took me two days. After a lot of spinning I finally found a hacky method on some internet thread that worked and moved on. Two lessons later when the ruby logic was starting to internalize, I had an epiphany about a way simpler way to write out the starting board code. It was a real *duh!* moment. Two things I learned from this: 

#### 1. Ask for help sooner 
If I had not been so stubborn about figuring this out on my own and used the question tool early on, I could have saved a lot of time and banging my head against the wall (figuratively).  

#### 2. Things will click eventually
This stuff is hard. It's up and down all the time. And that's okay. If it were easy, everyone would do it. There have already been so many impossible-seeming lessons that I figured out and moved on from. I remind myself of that whenever I'm stuck now.

My goodness. If that's just Tic Tac Toe, what's next?
