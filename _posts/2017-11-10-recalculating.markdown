Have you seen that Jeep commercial that's been all over recently? 

The one where you're watching different people make life-altering decisions to the chime of a Siri-esque voice saying *"recalculating"*? 

There's a girl on her way to her job at some bohemeth-looking corporate building... and she just turns around and walks away. There's a guy who breaks his (rather arbitrary, in my opinion) single-til-I'm-34 rule by proposing to his girlfriend on a hike. While I'm totally aware that I'm part of that millenial *cringe* audience Jeep is targeting here, I'm definitely eating up the whole message. Life changes and you adapt. What you want changes and you move forward with that. 

**That's why I'm doing Flatiron.**

(I was just about to clarify that I made this decision without seeing the Jeep commercial, but I just googled the release date and it was technically out there beforehand... did it totally seep into my subconscious??? I'll have to ponder this later.)

So what am I recalculating, exactly? My whole career. No big deal right?

Three months ago, I quit my job at Facebook. I know what you're thinking... what? That is one of the best companies to work for, why would you do that? Well, it *was* the best company I've ever worked for. I loved my managers and my team. I loved the free food. I loved the open culture. But I reached a point where I stopped growing and wasn't excited about where my career was going. Stability and perks weren't enough to make that feeling go away, so I knew I needed a change. 

To provide more context, my career thus far always had a finance backbone to it. I majored in business at UNC Chapel Hill, with a finance concentration to be extra practical. I was always good at math and I even enjoyed it. Plus I figured every company needs people to manage their money, so guaranteed employment. I prided myself on doing something with real-world application that would give my parents the return on their investment they fairly expected. 

After undergrad, I landed my first job as a financial analyst at Cisco, where I supported enterprise sales. I learned a ton about managing a budget for a large organization and everything that goes into sales forecasting and reporting. I was my VP's right-hand person and had a unique vantage point at the top of the business. But at the same time, I felt very disconnected from Cisco's actual products and customers. When you're looking at things from such a high level, everything becomes a bit abstract. And frankly, I didn't care about routers and switches. I wanted to work somewhere with a more relatable product. Something that I and my friends and family actually used and found joy in. I also wanted to escape the sheltered "back office" environment and interact more with people outside of just finance.

At Facebook, I got out of finance! Technically. This basically meant I no longer had to do super boring stuff like loading forecasts and accruals into the system. I know, *yawn.* But my world still revolved around how money got spent. The coolest new thing I got to do was partner with every team across the business, and this helped me figure out that I love interacting with different people all day. "The business" meant data centers and everything that went into planning for them, building them, and operating them. I really knew nothing about data centers before Facebook and left knowing more than I ever could have fathomed. I really became a translator between the engineering teams and non-engineering teams, which was weirdly fun.

**Then why change?**

Every job (and boyfriend, for that matter) teaches you something about yourself. At Cisco I learned I enjoy analyzing data, and at Facebook I learned I enjoy being that cross-section between teams. At Cisco I learned that a company's product really matters to me, and at Facebook I learned *drumroll* that I want to get even closer to shaping the product experience for the actual user. I'm slowly getting closer! The idea of working on a product team was never on my radar until I came to Facebook. And I became fascinated by it, taking intro classes in UX design and web languages like HTML/CSS to understand more. Keep in mind, I had known nothing but the finance and sales world. This was truly a revelation. 

Something I've left out of this narrative is the passion for art I've put on the backburner since joining the professional world. I used to take all of these art classes in high school, and I have this big portfolio that I've added to on and off since then. At Facebook, I channeled this creative side into designing Tableau dashboards and Powerpoint presentations. Dorky, I know. But I worked with what I had. My team would even refer to my visuals as "K-dub" (that was my nickname) material. And now I want to take that to the next level by committing to learning front-end development and UX design. My thought process is Flatiron can teach me the skills to land a job that feeds my craving for the analytical *and* the creative. And it's now or never. 

So I'm recalculating.
